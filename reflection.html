            Tackling a question is like running a marathon. It is challenging when we think that we can run straight to the finish line, but instead, we can break the marathon race into parts with finish lines in different parts of the race so that we can tackle them part by part.
            In this way, it is more achievable because once we have completed a small part of it, it is more achievable to continue the run. Similarly, Computational Think teaches us to solve a problem by decomposing it, then designing solutions to each part of the question. It is undoubtedly more efficient,
            straightforward, and painless to solve a question by breaking it down into minor problems.

            Before coming into this class, based on the name of it, I had the idea that this class was more of a theoretical course.
            However, as the course continued, I realized that Computational Thinking is also practical. For instance, as I mention in the definition of Computation Thinking,
            the process of designing a system and layout the plan’s foundation in order to solve the problem, the knowledge we have learned from this class will benefit us in our future careers.
            It is practical to have the logic of thought, which could be helpful in the programming process.

            In future courses, like fundamentals of programming, algorithms, and data structures, all require a skill like Computational Thinking. When problems become bigger and bigger,
            we need to decompose them and find all critical points in order to solve them. This leads to pattern recognition. We can analyze problems for similarities and differences with groups of problems,
            then simplify and categorize problems in specific groups. Pattern recognition is critical because code can be simplified with patterns in computer programming. Additionally, in machine learning, they can be used to make guesses or integrated into algorithms.

            Abstraction is the process of simplifying or categorizing ideas and objects, while decomposition is breaking them down into smaller parts. Finally, we can now use the information we find to structure a plan and make a step-by-step program to solve complex problems.
            Algorithmic thinking expands pattern recognition’s ability to learn and create rules about actions by asking them to understand and create general rules for actions.

            Furthermore, It is interesting to understand how number system functions in computers and how binary number system switches to other number systems like octal and hexadecimal. How number system store as bite in computer’s memory.
            It is magical that computers we use daily can be super powerful based on these number systems. The number system plays an essential role in the computer system, which transfers our code to a binary system allowing the computer to understand and run it.
            I think it is crucial to understand the number system for future courses as it lays a foundation for how the computer understands and runs our code based on the number system.

            In conclusion, the knowledge we learned from this course paves the groundwork for future courses, even in our future careers.
            We can use the knowledge in CT, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms, to solve more complex problems in our upcoming courses. In addition, the number system provides a basic understanding of how code performs using the hardware and interacts with the computer,
            which could be beneficial for us in coordinating software and hardware in the future.
