            Professor Jeannette M.Wing first popularized the idea of computational thinking at Carnegie Mellon University.
            When it comes to computational thinking, many first think about how to think like computers or make them understand our code to function. On the contrary,
            computation thinking is much more than that. It is a way of thinking, a way to solve complicated problems,
            applied to not only computer scientists but also folks like students, educators, biologists, chemists, physicists, and everyone who tries to solve complex problems. Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior.

            Computational thinking is a process that can exist independently of technologies such as computers, the Internet, and artificial intelligence. It is human thinking rather than computer thinking.
            Humans use computational thinking to control computers and other equipment to more efficiently and quickly complete tasks that humans cannot complete alone and solve problems that could not be completed before the computing era.
            Computational thinking is the standard way for cognition and thinking in the future world. Computational thinking can enable people to understand better and control the future world.

            The concept of computational thinking is fundamental to the program we are studying now and to our future careers. For instance, in all aspects of programming,
            we will have to define the problem, design a system, and understand what humans need from the system. Lastly, we scheme the foundation of our program. Computational thinking skills will be crucial skills in our future studies and careers. When we face a challenging question,
            we can always break it down, find valuable information, look for a shared pattern, and create an algorithm that operates.

            It even goes beyond the field of computer science, even if we are not working in the field of computer science. Computational thinking can utilize in our everyday life. For instance,
            a chef can use computational thinking skills to prepare meals for the whole restaurant,
            what customers want, and what they share in common, and create a daily rotation. Computational thinking is a way of thinking and straightening out problems.
