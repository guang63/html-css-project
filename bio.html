        <h2>the man who revolutionized the world of computer science</h2>

        <p>
            There are many influential computer scientists who have had considerable impacts on the computer world,
            but Sir Tim Berners-Lee definitely is one of the heavyweights among computer scientists.
            Tim Berners-Lee is the founding father of the modern-day World Wide Web. Furthermore, he is one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. The visionary and innovative work of Sir Tim Berners-Lee has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives.

            Berners-Lee invented the Web while he was at CERN in 1989, and he continued to work on making it freely accessible to all afterward. He is now working on enhancing and protecting the Web.
            World Wide Web Foundation, whose mission is to establish the Web to serve people as a global public good and fundamental right, was founded by him. Additionally, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to lead the Web to its full potential.
            Many governments and corporations have employed Sir Tim to advise on their digital strategies. As an Oxford University graduate, Sir Tim currently holds academic positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford.

        <p>
            To conclude, Sir Berners-Lee’s contribution to computer science is astonishing. Without computer scientists like Tim Berners-Lee, we will not have the modern-day Web, which connects all nations regardless of distance, time, and physical barriers.
            It is unthinkable to live without the World Wide Web as a Millennial. The Web has become a basic need for us, just like food, water, and electricity. It is hard to imagine how we interact and communicate with each other without social sites like Twitter and Facebook when we are back at home.
            Furthermore, online shopping will not exist without the Web, which is unthinkable because we depend so much on online shopping. Sir Tim Berners-Lee not only influenced the advancement of the computer science industry, as well as our daily life.
